/**
 * A special comparator that uses a CAL function of type a -> a -> Ordering to
 * define the compare method.
 * 
 * This is used to implement the built-in primitive function defined in the Prelude module:
 * makeComparator :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> JComparator 
 * where JComparator is a foreign type corresponding to java.util.Comparator.
 * 
 * The actual implementation class returned by a call to makeComparator is a RTComparator.
