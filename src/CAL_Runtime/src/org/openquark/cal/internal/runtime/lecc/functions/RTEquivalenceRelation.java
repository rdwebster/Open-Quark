 * This is used to implement the built-in primitive function defined in the Prelude module:
 * makeEquivalenceRelation :: (a -> a -> Boolean) -> JEquivalenceRelation 
 * where JEquivalenceRelation is a foreign type corresponding to 
 * org.openquark.cal.foreignsupport.core.EquivalenceRelation.
 * 
 * The actual implementation class returned by a call to makeComparator is a RTEquivalenceRelation.
